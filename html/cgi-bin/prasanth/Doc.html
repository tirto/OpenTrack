<h2>
<a NAME="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
Job Tracking System (JTS) is an online computer-service-request management
system. JTS allows service manager to manage all requests via a web browser.&nbsp;
Figure 1 is an overview of JTS.
<h2>
<a NAME="requestform"></a>Request From</h2>
Request form is where service requesters fill out information in order
to request a service. Figure 2 show a snap shot of the request form. The
form is generated by a Perl script called jobTrack.pl. This script is under
/httpd/cgi-bin/ directory.
<p>jobTrack.pl also responds for validating a submitted form and saving
information of a submitted form to the database.
<p>After inserting a new request into the database, jobrequest table, the
script will send emails to notify the requester that the request have been
received and to notify the service manager that there is another request
has been submitted.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="database"></a>Database</h2>
Database is the central part of JTS. All request forms and other management
information are kept here. The database contains three tables.
<ul>
<li>
JobRequest contains information that requesters submitted.</li>

<li>
JobManage contains management information used by service manager and persons
who respond to the requests.</li>

<li>
AssignList contains a list of names of persons who will respond to the
requests and their email addresses. Figure 3 shows a diagram of these table
and their data fields.</li>
</ul>
There are two triggers in this database: jobrequest_after_ins_row and deljobmanage.
The source code of these triggers are sampletrigger.sql and deltrigger.sql
and they locate at /httpd/cgi-bin/JobTrackHotline/.
<p>When there is a new record inserted into jobRequest table, jobrequest_after_ins_row
is triggered and a coresponding record will be insert into jobManage. In
reverse, when a record is deleted from jobRequest, its coresponding record
in jobManage is deleted by deljobmanage.
<p><i>Note: Always insert new records into and delete existing record from
jobRequest. The other way does not work since there is not trigger to automatically
insert a record into or delete a record from jobRequest when there is a
record insert into or delete from jobManage.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="management"></a>Management</h2>
When a request form is submitted, the service manager is notified by an
email generated by jobTrack.pl. The service manager can retrieve the request,
add comments, and forward it to a person who will respond to the request.
<p>This part involves several Perl scripts. They are under /httpd/cgi-bin/JobTrackSuper/.
One script might relate to others, but each script handles a specific function.
<h4>
<a NAME="m_editlist"></a>Edit List</h4>

<blockquote>This function is hangle by editList.pl. It allows the user
to add or remove names that he can forward requests to. Since the names
in this list can have their own lists, the user will have options whether
to delete a name and its sublist or just delete the name and transfer its
sublist to another person.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_deleterequests"></a>Delete Requests</h4>

<blockquote>This function is handle by delJob.pl. It allows the user to
delete existing requests. It lists all the existing requests in the table.
The user can select to delete more than one requests at a time or view
the content of a request before deleting it. This function is handle by
jobEdit.pl.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_menu"></a>Display Menu</h4>

<blockquote>This is done by menu.cgi. It list all functions that are available
to the user.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_listdetail"></a>List Details</h4>

<blockquote>This function displays a request in details. Both information
submitted by a requester and management information are displayed. This
is where the user add comments, change the status, change the priority,
make a title for the request, and forward it to a person who will respond
to the request.
<p>The user can also select to send an email to the requester to notify
that the request has been forward to a right person.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_listrequests"></a>List Requests</h4>

<blockquote>The user can choose different ways to list requests in the
database. Searching is one way to list the requests. The basic listing
function allows the user to list requests based on status such as new requests,
in processed, or finished. This function is handled by jobEdit.pl.
<p>Requests are listed in a table with ID number, name of requester, name
of person who respond to the requests, and the request's titles. Each of
the requests in the table has a link that the user can select to view it
in detail.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_searchrequests"></a>Search Requests</h4>

<blockquote>This function allows the user to search for a request by the
following criteria.
<ul>
<li>
Search by a specific date and status.</li>

<li>
Search by a range of date and status.</li>
</ul>
Requests that matched with the criteria are listed in the same format as
in the listing function.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_setupframe"></a>Set up Frame</h4>

<blockquote>frameset.cgi is the first script that is called when the user
logins. It patitions a web browser into two frames. One frame is for menu
bar, a list of functions available to the user. The other frame is for
displaying information such as a list of requests or a detail of a request.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="m_update"></a>Update Information</h4>

<blockquote>After the user has added comments, changed priority, or forward
a request to another person, the information has to be updated in the database.
This is done by jobChange.pl.
<p>If the user choose to send an email to the requester, the script will
generates and sends an email to the requester with an email address of
the person that will respond to the request.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="responder"></a>Service Responding</h2>
Like the management part, this part involves several Perl scripts. The
scripts are under /home/httpd/cgi-bin/JobTrackHotline/. The function of
each script is list below.
<p>This part is for persons who respond to the request to update status
and comments for the requests.
<h4>
<a NAME="editlist"></a>Edit List</h4>

<blockquote>This function is hangle by editList.pl. It allows the user
to add or remove names that he can forward requests to.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="displaymenu"></a>Display Menu</h4>

<blockquote>This is done by menu.pl. It list all functions that are available
to the user.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="listdetail"></a>List Details</h4>

<blockquote>This function is handled by changeStatus.pl. It displays a
request in details. Both information submitted by a requester and management
information are displayed. This is where the user add comments and change
the status.
<p>The user can only set the status either active or finished. The user
can also forward the request to any one in his list.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="listrequests"></a>List Requests</h4>

<blockquote>The user can choose different ways to list requests in the
database. Searching is one way to list the requests. The basic listing
function allows the user to list requests based on status such as in processed,
or finished.
<p>This function is handled by changeStatus.pl. Requests are listed in
a table with ID number, name of requester, name of person who respond to
the requests, and the request's titles. Each of the requests in the table
has a link that the user can select to view it in detail.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="searchrequests"></a>Search Requests</h4>

<blockquote>This function allows the user to search for a request by the
following criteria.

<ul>
<li>
Search by a specific date and status.</li>

<li>
Search by a range of date and status.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests that matched with the criteria are listed in the same format
as in the listing function.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="setupframe"></a>Set up Frame</h4>

<blockquote>hotline.pl is the first script that is called when the user
logins. It patitions a web browser into two frames. One frame is for menu
bar, a list of functions available to the user. The other frame is for
displaying information such as a list of requests or a detail of a request.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="update"></a>Update Information</h4>

<blockquote>After the user has added comments, changed status, or forwarded
