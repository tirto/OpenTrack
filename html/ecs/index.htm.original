<p align="center"><big>Instructions for Setting Up the &quot;public_html&quot; Directory</big><br>
</p>

<p></b><font size="3">The general idea is that you need to have a directory within your
home directory on the login server that is named &quot;public_html.&quot; Once we created
that directory, set the permissions for world readability, you can locate your web
documents and graphics files within the directory, you will be able to access your site
with one of the following URLs (your choice):</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/~username<br>
  http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/username</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">where &quot;username&quot; is replaced with your specific COE Web login
(username). The &quot;~username&quot; is merely an alias for
&quot;/home/username/public_html&quot; so that others trying to access your site do not
have to enter that entire string, but just a tilde (~) and a user's login. You may also
create subdirectories within the &quot;public_html&quot; directory, and as long as you
include them in the path of the URL, you can access those documents through the web as
well. For example, if you have a file that you would like to use named &quot;bkg.gif&quot;
within a subdirectory named &quot;images,&quot; you could call the file in the HTML
document (or from your web browser) as:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/~username/images/bkg.gif</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">or as a relative URL in a document located within the
&quot;public_html&quot; directory as:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">images/bkg.gif</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The detailed process is as follows.</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font size="3">Connect to the COE Web with your Internet access.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Launch your FTP client software, either Fetch or WS FTP (or another FTP
    client of your choosing)</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Perform a NON-ANONYMOUS login to your account space using the following
    information (text in [brackets] must be replaced with your specific information):</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="3">Remote Host: www.engr.sjsu.edu</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Login (User ID): [your login at COE Web]</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Password: [your COE Web password]</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Initial Directory: LEAVE BLANK</font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">When you connect to the server, since you are performing a NON-ANONYMOUS
login with FTP, you should end up at your home directory, which is just where you want to
be.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Create a new directory (in Fetch, select &quot;Create New
Directory&quot; from the &quot;Directories&quot; pull-down menu - in WS FTP, click on the
&quot;mkdir&quot; button next to the upper left window) named:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font size="3">public_html</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">In most cases, it should already have the permissions set to the proper
levels, which are:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font size="3">owner (&quot;user&quot;): read, write, execute</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">group: read, execute</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">other: read, execute</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">You will know that you need to alter the permissions IF you try to look
at your web site in a browser with the URL format shown above and are denied access. If
you get an error message instead of an &quot;index of...&quot; page, you need to adjust
the permissions to the above levels.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To do that with Fetch (MAC), go to your home directory if you are not
already there, select the &quot;public_html&quot; directory in the window by clickingonce
on it, then select &quot;Set Permissions&quot; from under the &quot;Remote&quot; pull-down
menu. The resulting window that appears lets you select which permissions to give what
users. Please set them to match those listed above.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">NOTE: All text files (HTML, CGI documents) must be uploaded with ASCII
mode on, whereas any images, sound files, etc. must be uploaded with Binary mode on. In
both Fetch and WS FTP, you can select &quot;Auto&quot; and the software will automatically
determine which mode must be used for each file you transfer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Again, if you need help figuring this out, see our online documentation
on using your software (URLs for these pages listed at the top of this document).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Your site will be accessible with one of the following URLs: <br>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/~username <br>
  http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/username&nbsp; </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3"><br>
Where &quot;username&quot; is replaced with your login. If your login is &quot;jdoe,&quot;
your site's URL will be any of these: <br>
</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/~jdoe <br>
  http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/jdoe</font></p>
</blockquote>
