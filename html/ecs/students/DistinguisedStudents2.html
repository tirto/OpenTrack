          Computer Systems is comprised of a mixture of staff and student employees. 
          During their stay here, the student personnel not only provide invaluable 
          support, but are able to hone and put to practice use some of the academic 
          skills gained through coursework. The pride ECS feels for these students 
          does not come to an end when the individual moves on. </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
