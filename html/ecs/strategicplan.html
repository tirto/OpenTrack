<H1><B>I. Executive Summary</B></H1>
<P><B>The Engineering 
  Computing Systems (ECS) strategic plan is an attempt to set new directions and 
  create strategies for improving information resources and technology support 
  for faculty, staff, and students within the College of Engineering (COE) at 
  San Jos&eacute; State University (SJSU).</B></P>
<P><B>When Dean Donald Kirk challenged me with the task of creating a &quot;Five 
  Year Plan&quot; for computing, I was at a complete loss as to where I should 
  begin. So in the mood of the times, I turned to the Internet and began searching 
  peer institutions for ideas about how they approached the problem. This report 
  represents the catharsis of my research. Over thirty universities from around 
  the globe are represented in this report. It is therefore </B><B>understandable 
  that few ideas presented here are original. However, I feel that all the ideas 
  chosen for inclusion are relevant to the College of Engineering and our future. 
  </B></P>
<P><B>A special word of thanks is offered to the creators of the Indiana State 
  University, University of Connecticut, University of Missouri, The National 
  University of Singapore, and University of Saskatchewan strategic planning committees, 
  for I have drawn heavily from their respective reports. After reading the reports 
  of these and other peer institutions, several patterns emerged as consistent 
  themes. Naturally, the infrastructure and Internet were common themes. Funding 
  was almost always mentioned, as were concerns about personnel, and the continuing 
  effects technology will have on our future.</B></P>
<P><B>Very few 
  reports actually projected their strategies into five year plans. Three years 
  seemed to be the most extreme range of speculation. Many institutions focused 
  on the concept of a &quot;living document&quot; or the adoption of some form 
  of quantifiable yearly progress report. Due to the radical changes already experienced 
  by the growth of technology, the careful step-by-step approaches seem in keeping 
  with the extremely volatile nature of technology. As with most of the reports, 
  I tend to prefer the annual review process as a balanced approach to planning 
  for our future, as opposed to an all encompassing five year plan.</B></P>
<P><B>The most 
  important theme that I observed throughout all the papers was the need for increased 
  involvement in information technology at every level of the institution. In 
  the coming years, it is doubtful that few things will affect our lives more 
  than technology; therefore, the greater our participation and planning, the 
  greater our impact on the future.</B></P>

<H1><B>II. Engineering Computing Systems</B></H1>
<P><B>The Engineering 
  Computing Systems group is composed of seven full time employees and approximately 
  fifteen student assistants. With some degree of overlap, each full time employee 
  oversees a specific area of expertise such as networking, World Wide Web (WWW) 
  publishing, open student laboratories, research laboratories, desktop support, 
  hardware repair, and administrative systems support. The members of ECS work 
  closely with faculty, staff, and students in the day-to-day operations of the 
  College of Engineering (COE), San Jos&eacute; State University (SJSU), and the 
  greater Silicon Valley computer community as a whole.</B></P>

<H1><B>III. Mission</B></H1>
<P><B>The mission 
  of ECS is to provide information technology systems, services, computing facilities, 
  and network infrastructure to support the College of Engineering in achieving 
  its academic and administrative missions and goals.</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><BR>
  <BR>
  <A NAME="vision"></A><FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#top">[Table of Contents]</A></FONT> 
  </B></P>
<H1><B>IV. Vision</B></H1>
<P><B>The vision 
  of ECS is to provide ubiquitous technology-enhanced educational systems and 
  services to all College of Engineering faculty, students, and staff.</B></P>
<P><B>To succeed 
  we must build a consensus for our strategic vision. The Dean and Council of 
  Chairs must adopt and commit to our vision for it to succeed. Faculty, staff, 
  and students must be included in the process at every level of creation and 
  implementation. </B></P>
<P><B>A strategic 
  information technology vision for the College of Engineering is imperative. 
  For without vision, we are not &quot;Engineering A New Millennium.&quot;</B></P>

<H1><B>V. Importance Of Information Resources</B></H1>
<P><B>Unlike 
  natural resources, information is a resource that is not depleted as it is used. 
  Instead, it increases in value as it is used and re-used to create knowledge.</B></P>
<P><B>Information 
  is at the heart of the teaching and learning process and of the research, creative 
  development, and public services. Information technology supplies the tools 
  to build and enhance educational systems.</B></P>
<P><B>The application 
  of computers and networks has a positive and multifaceted role in the information 
  revolution. First, computers and networks help manage and store information 
  in ways that allow easy access, retrieval, and manipulation. Second, they increase 
  productivity in the creation of new information. Third, they enable more communication 
  and collaboration among individuals for the purpose of sharing information, 
  thus enabling the creation of new communities of scholars. </B></P>
<P><B>The challenge of educational facilities to implement technology has grown 
  exponentially in the past few years. Information technology is now an integral 
  part of every modern educational facility.</B></P>
<P><B>Few occurrences 
  point out the importance of information resources more than the upcoming &quot;Year 
  2000 Bug.&quot; Without question, whether any serious damage occurs or not, 
  the event has raised awareness among the general public about the systemic nature 
  of technology and our dependence on it. On New Year's Eve, of the year 2000, 
  most thinking individuals will count down the seconds and wonder, &quot;Will 
  the lights go out?&quot; Technology and information resources now connect everyone 
  on this very small planet.</B></P>

<H1><B> VI. Relevance of Information Technologies</B></H1>
<P><B>The computing 
  environment has changed radically during the past five years. No forecasting 
  in the early 1990s, when the Internet began emerging, could have accurately 
  envisioned the all encompassing and global nature of information technology 
  today. </B></P>
<P><B>The development 
  trend has been and will likely continue to be smaller, faster, and cheaper computers, 
  workstations, and personal devices. The cost of computers relative to their 
  performance has dropped drastically. It is expected that this trend will continue, 
  and predictions are that capacity for processing power of computer chips in 
  the next five years will exceed the capacity of today's PowerPC, Pentium, and 
  Merced chips by many times, along with a large corresponding increase in memory. 
  Such systems, along with advanced networking capacity, will offer new opportunities 
  to support teaching, learning, research, and the day-to-day operations of, including 
  access to and delivery of multimedia databases, video conferencing, imaging, 
  and complex simulation and modeling databases. Never has the future of pedagogy 
  been brighter.</B></P>
<P><B>Computers, 
  networking, and telephone technologies increasingly will be used to deliver 
  distance learning courses both as a supplement to and, in some cases, a replacement 
  for courses delivered via video. Ongoing demands will outstrip capacity within 
  the next few years (if not already), particularly for multimedia data, document 
  imaging, audio/video conferencing, and increased use of the Internet. Installation 
  of additional fiber-optic broadband and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks 
  currently are the likely directions for increasing capacity. Nonetheless, we 
  are in the beginning of the information age. The advances made in personal computers 
  in the last ten years will continue to be reflected in networking and the interconnectivity 
  of personal devices in the future.</B></P>
<P><B>Software 
  continues to become increasingly user friendly. The learning curve once associated 
  with computing on the desktop has all but disappeared. Today, technology has 
  advanced to the point of waiting for us, rather than us waiting for it. Today, 
  creativity in our use of technology is a greater factor than the ability of 
  technology to produce results.</B></P>

<H1><B> VII. Planning Assumptions</B></H1>
<P><B>Planning for the future is a daunting task, especially in the field of information 
  technology. However, we must plan; for not to plan is the worst mistake we can 
  make. The following list contains some of the more commonly recognized factors 
  that can affect strategic planning.</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Costs will always be an 
      inhibiting factor.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Many students will enter the College of Engineering with increasing 
      expectations and sophistication about accessing information resources and 
      technology in support of learning.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Increasing needs and expectations 
      of the workplace will require college graduates to be knowledgeable in the 
      use of information resources, computers, and networks.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Faculty requests will 
      increase for access to and support of information resources and technologies 
      for teaching and research.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>The need to upgrade, replace, 
      and enhance computer hardware and software, networks, and information resources 
      will be ongoing.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>More often, Engineering 
      Computing Systems will be called upon to offer consultation, training, and 
      services and to assist faculty to integrate information resources and technologies 
      into instruction.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>There will be increased 
      use of enhanced multimedia capabilities merging voice, full-motion video, 
      still visuals, and text to support instruction in the classroom.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Pressure will continue 
      to grow from the private sector to hire skilled personnel from the university 
      environment with higher paying jobs and benefits.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Funding from the State 
      of California will continue to be uncertain. Thus, partnerships with off-campus 
      entities and external funding will become increasingly important.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Training in order to stay 
      abreast of technological changes will become more necessary.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Service centers are traditionally 
      under-funded relative to demand.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>It is unlikely that we 
      can increase our tuition rates sufficiently to cover new costs. </B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>We are not likely to be 
      successful in implementing a &quot;technology fee.&quot;</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Currently there appears 
      to be little support for a &quot;lease to buy&quot; laptop program. If such 
      a program were adopted, it should probably originate from the CIO's office 
      and be voluntarily implemented at the college level.</B></P>

<H1><B>VIII. Engineering Computing System's Strategic Plan</B></H1>
<P><B>Ideally, 
  a strategic plan should define a course of action. In this instance, many courses 
  of action are proposed to achieve our vision. The primary intent of this document 
  is not to present a map to the future, but rather to stir discussion about where 
  we are technologically and where we want to be in one-to-five years. The following 
  goals are offered in keeping with our vision of providing &quot;ubiquitous technology-enhanced 
  educational systems and services.&quot; In essence, our plan is to pursue our 
  goals until our vision of the future is a reality. With the help and input of 
  the combined College of Engineering faculty, staff, and students we shall define 
  a course of action in keeping with our vision. The following goals are suggestions 
  for achieving our vision:</B></P>

<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>If we are to succeed, a source of funds must be identified. Funding 
      is a key element if significant advances are to be made in the University's 
      strategic use of IT.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>The lack of endorsement 
      at the Dean and Council of Chairs level.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Plans must be capable 
      of being implemented and sustained.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Plans must realistically 
      reflect the COE's resources.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Plans and programs must 
      be focused and prioritized.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>The lack of appropriate 
      motivation and rewards for IT integration.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Expectations beyond our 
      resources.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>The pace of technological 
      change.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Political shifts at both 
      the university, state, and national level.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Continue without a plan.</B></P>
</UL>
<P><B>The biggest 
  risk is doing nothing and hoping the future will take care of itself. In the 
  final analysis, doing nothing is the most dangerous approach The current system 
  of &quot;act-react&quot; or &quot;fire-fighting&quot; cannot sustain us into 
  the future. We must develop and adopt a realistic plan and strategy for the 
  future.</B></P>

<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>A detailed analysis of 
      the current information technology environment within the College of Engineering 
      should immediately be undertaken.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>The Dean and Council of 
      Chairs should embrace a vision for information technology and communicate 
      this vision as a major College of Engineering policy.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>Following upon the communication 
      of a College of Engineering information technology strategy, academic Chairs 
      should be instructed to develop departmental academic plans that set forth 
      goals for the integration of technology into the teaching, learning, research, 
      and service missions of their individual departments.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>All College of Engineering 
      departmental strategic plans should be reviewed on a yearly basis by the 
      Information Technology Committee for inclusion into and enhancement of the 
      greater College of Engineering information technology strategic plan.</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>A task force should be 
      appointed to develop and recommend a coordinated funding strategy for information 
      technology within the College of Engineering.<BR>
