How to get statistics on lab usage

On lab NT server, run 'usrstat' tool from NT server resource kit and
save output to a file. On Linux system, do the following to the
resulting file:

How many accounts exist
wc -l results.txt

How many accounts never used
grep Never results.txt | wc -l

The difference between the two is how many accounts were used one
or more times.
