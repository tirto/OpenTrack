* Each detail view of a request will have a table of charges associated
  with that project. The table will be enumerated as follows:

  charge id, order date, description, department, amount

  Below that will be a total for all charges to that project.

* Clicking on an entry on the table of charges allows you to edit that
  entry or delete it.

* There will be a button which allows you to add another entry.

* There will be additional choices on the menu to the left to:
  - Monthly charges

* Each request in the summary view has a total charge for that project
  listed.
